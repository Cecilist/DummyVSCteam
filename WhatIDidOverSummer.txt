Summer 2021
My summer wasn't too exciting. I helped my parents with two litters of puppies, and when I wasn't taking car of dogs, I was at work. 
Over summer I worked at the Valparasio Target as a Starbucks Team Member, which means I got to work at the in-store Starbucks kiosk. 
I've since transferred to the Muncie Target Starbucks, so feel free to come visit. One of my coworkers got me into a new (to me) card game called Carfight Vanguard, 
and that was kind of neat. I had planned to attempt some coding projects, but ended up not being to busy helping with dogs, both puppy and adult.

Summer 2021
This summer I worked as and Information Security Analyst Intern for a company called Human Interest in San Francisco California. Human Interest is a start up tech company offering retirement plans to businesses. I mostly worked with Darktrace Antigena to get to know the product and work out the kinks so it could work better for our company. This Summer I also worked a lot with my puppy Beau on training. He is now 9 months old and still full of energy. I also got a new Oculus Quest 2 VR headset so I have been playing that a lot as well.
