Summer 2021
My summer wasn't too exciting. I helped my parents with two litters of puppies, and when I wasn't taking car of dogs, I was at work. 
Over summer I worked at the Valparasio Target as a Starbucks Team Member, which means I got to work at the in-store Starbucks kiosk. 
I've since transferred to the Muncie Target Starbucks, so feel free to come visit. One of my coworkers got me into a new (to me) card game called Carfight Vanguard, 
and that was kind of neat. I had planned to attempt some coding projects, but ended up not being to busy helping with dogs, both puppy and adult.

Summer 2021
My summer was overall pretty good! Most of what I did over summer was work. I worked as a server at a restaurant called The Local Eatery and Pub and really enjoyed it. The job
gave me the opprotunity to meet new people and learn the different aspects of customer service. When I had the chance I would also play golf with my friends which was a ton of
fun and kept me active. When I wasn't working or golfing, I would spend most of the time either watching Youtube videos, playing guitar, playing video games, or working on 
simple coding projects.
