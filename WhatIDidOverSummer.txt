Summer 2021
My summer was overall pretty good! Most of what I did over summer was work. I worked as a server at a restaurant called The Local Eatery and Pub and really enjoyed it. The job gave me the opprotunity to meet new people and learn the different aspects of customer service. When I had the chance I would also play golf with my friends which was a ton of fun and kept me active. When I wasn't working or golfing, I would spend most of the time either watching Youtube videos, playing guitar, playing video games, or working on simple coding projects.
