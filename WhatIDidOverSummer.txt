Summer 2021
My summer wasn't too exciting. I helped my parents with two litters of puppies, and when I wasn't taking car of dogs, I was at work. 
Over summer I worked at the Valparasio Target as a Starbucks Team Member, which means I got to work at the in-store Starbucks kiosk. 
I've since transferred to the Muncie Target Starbucks, so feel free to come visit. One of my coworkers got me into a new (to me) card game called Carfight Vanguard, 
and that was kind of neat. I had planned to attempt some coding projects, but ended up not being to busy helping with dogs, both puppy and adult.
